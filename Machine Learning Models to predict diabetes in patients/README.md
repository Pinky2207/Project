## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed missing values, feature distributions, and correlations  
   - Visualized relationships between features and diabetes outcome  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encoded categorical variables using **OneHotEncoder**  
   - Used **ColumnTransformer** to handle mixed data types  
   - Applied **StandardScaler** for numerical feature scaling  

3. **Model Training & Testing**  
   - Split dataset into training and test sets  
   - Trained multiple regression models (Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated performance using:  
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
     - Root Mean Absolute Error (RMAE)  
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
     - R¬≤ Score  
   - Performed **Cross-Validation with K-Folds** for robust model evaluation  

5. **Model Insights**  
   - Compared models to understand strengths and weaknesses  
   - Identified Random Forest and Gradient Boosting as stronger performers due to their ability to capture non-linear relationships  
   - Noted limitations of Linear Regression with complex feature interactions
