# 🔍 ElasticSearch Indexing & Text Processing

This project demonstrates how to set up and use **ElasticSearch** for indexing and text processing tasks such as **tokenization** and **normalization**.  
The goal is to explore how ElasticSearch can be used to efficiently store, search, and analyze textual data.

## 📘 Project Overview
- Set up **ElasticSearch using Docker**  
- Used **Jupyter Notebook** for running experiments  
- Imported datasets in **JSON format** and indexed them into ElasticSearch  
- Applied **default mapping** for data indexing  
- Performed **tokenization** and **normalization** for text processing  
- Launched ElasticSearch instance and interacted with it via the **web browser**
