# üì¶ On-Time Shipment Prediction

This project predicts whether a shipment will arrive **on time** or **delayed** using machine learning techniques.  
It leverages data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling to help logistics companies and e-commerce platforms optimize delivery performance and enhance customer satisfaction.

## üìò Project Overview
Late shipments can significantly impact customer trust and operational efficiency.  
This project aims to:
- Analyze shipment data to identify key factors influencing delivery times  
- Handle missing values and preprocess raw data for machine learning  
- Train classification models to predict on-time vs delayed shipments  
- Visualize insights for better decision-making

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key steps in data exploration:
- Checked for **missing values** using `missingno` and imputed where necessary  
- Visualized feature distributions and correlations using Seaborn  
- Identified shipment-related factors such as:
  - Distance  
  - Shipment mode (Air, Sea, Road)  
  - Warehouse-to-destination mapping  
  - Delivery priority and weight  
  - Weather/holiday influence (if available)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Load dataset with Pandas  
   - Handle missing values with imputation techniques  
   - Normalize and encode categorical variables  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize trends in shipment delays  
   - Identify correlations between shipment features and delivery outcome  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create new features (e.g., shipping distance buckets, priority categories)  
   - Perform scaling and transformation as needed  

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets  
   - Train multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)  
   - Evaluate using metrics such as:
     - Accuracy  
     - Precision, Recall, F1-score  
     - ROC-AUC curve  

5. **Visualization & Insights**  
   - Plot feature importance  
   - Visualize confusion matrices and ROC curves  
   - Provide actionable insights for logistics improvement
